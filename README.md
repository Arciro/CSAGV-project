# CSAGV-project
In this repository you can find the challenge launched to pass the exam "Control Systems for Autonomous Ground Vechicles"

## Description & Instruction for use
The challenge aim is to design an ADAS system for a connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) traveling in a highway scenario in a such a way to satisfy some requirements. For more details read power point presentation **challenge essay**.

For this project we used Matlab & Simulink, specifically we exploited 2 toolboxes:

- Model Predictive Control Toolbox
- Automated Driving Toolbox

So before running file in **File Matlab & Simulink** folder, be sure to install these toolboxes.

## Running simulation
In order to follow the development of my project, I suggest you to see my power point presentation called **Presentation**. Tou can see the project divided in three parts.

### 1st part: Open loop analysis
In order to visualize results of the open loop analysis you have to run following files:

1) In the folder called Matlab & Simulink files run the matlab file *data_cav.m*
2) After that run Simulink file named as *cav_nonlinear_model.slx*
3) Finally if you want to run Matlab plot, run also *plot_nonlinear.m*

### 2nd part: ADAS design
